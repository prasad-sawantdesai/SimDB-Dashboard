# Development guide

The SimDB dashboard frontend is a Vite/Vue single-page app. The recommended development workflow is to run the Vite dev server through Make using Docker.

## Setting up a development environment

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iterorganization/SimDB-Dashboard.git
cd SimDB-Dashboard
```

2. Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
make dev
```

3. Open the app in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:5173/dashboard/
```

The `make dev` target runs the Docker `dev` stage and starts Vite with live reload enabled. Source changes under `dashboard/` are mounted into the container and reflected immediately.

## Other useful commands

Run lint checks:

```bash
make lint
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
make test
```

The `make test` target runs the Docker `test` stage. At the moment, the project does not include test files yet, so this target is configured to pass even when no tests are found.
